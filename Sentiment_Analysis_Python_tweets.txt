RT @ In 2006, Obama talked about the "wave of illegal immigration flooding our southern border" and how it "threatens to depress further the wages of blue-collar Americans."   He sounded a lot like @realDonaldTrump back then  #BuildTheDamnWallNow    https://t.co/zMaGEPYX6p
RT @ ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been advising the president whether on Twitter, in columns, or in private conversations you‚Äôre not allowed to know about, since Election Day.‚Äù   Here‚Äôs Awful Ann Coulter telling @vicenews tonight she does in fact have the president‚Äôs ear on immigration. https://t.co/gBItcHWvbO
@LeaderHoyer @RepKatieHill @repdavidtrone @POTUS Come to the table negotiate a deal! We need border security and immigration reform!
RT @ Hundreds of migrants have formed a new caravan that‚Äôs heading north toward our southern border.    @realDonaldTrump is right to push for more border security.   It‚Äôs time Democrats put the country first and  work with him. https://t.co/KWUkSDmN6l
RT @ Whenever I meet someone who is going through US immigration we immediately bond over how much the dumb, opaque process sucks. I wrote about that and a little website that kept me sane for the @outline. Enjoy! https://t.co/ClzwdEXTYS

RT @ Lindsey Graham said he spoke to Trump today about the shutdown and said to him if there‚Äôs a critical mass of senators from both parties working on an immigration deal it would make sense to reopen govt. Trump has previously rejected Graham effort to reopen govt for three weeks
